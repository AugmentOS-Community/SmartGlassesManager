## Why Use The Smart Glasses Manager?

### Developers
Building apps that run on a smart phone and stream data to smart glasses is hard, but it’s how today’s lightweight smart glasses work. We handle the connection, UI, data streaming, and transcription, allowing you to rapidly develop smart glasses applications that run on any pair of smart glasses.

### Industry
Your smart glasses won’t see massive consumer adoption if third party developers can’t make awesome apps for your hardware. The SmartGlassesManager is a middleware which already supports many apps and makes it easy for developers to build more. That means, if you add support to your hardware for a single application – the SmartGlassesManager – your glasses will instantly support a plethora of consumer-facing applications.
